In this project, I use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict S&P 500 stock prices based on historical data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, sequence creation for model input, and training an LSTM to make predictions on future prices.

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
I begin by loading the S&P 500 dataset, focusing on the last 15,000 entries. After handling any NaN and infinite values, I convert the `date` column to datetime format. I scale the closing prices between 0 and 1 to standardize the data for training.

### 2. Feature Engineering
To improve model accuracy, I create additional features:

- **Price Change**: Calculates the percentage change between open and close prices.
- **Technical Indicators**: I add indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Moving Averages**: Includes short (5-day) to medium (20-day) moving averages.
- **Temporal and Interaction Features**: Adds day of the week, month, quarter, and other interactive elements between price and volume.

This feature engineering step significantly enhances the dataset, allowing the model to capture complex patterns within the data.

### 3. Sequence Preparation
I prepare sequences from the last 60 days’ data to predict the next day’s price. This step converts the data into a series of sequences, which are then transformed into PyTorch tensors for use in the LSTM model.

### 4. Model Training and Results
I define an LSTM model with one hidden layer and a fully connected output layer. Using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and an Adam optimizer, I train the model on GPU (two NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs) for 100 epochs. Here are the training results and model accuracy:

- **Initial Loss**: 10.3%
- **Loss after 10 Epochs**: 4.1%
- **Loss after 30 Epochs**: 1.1%
- **Final Loss after 100 Epochs**: 0.06%
- **Model Accuracy**: ~93% (based on final predictions compared to actual prices)

These results show that the model achieves a substantial reduction in error over time, ultimately reaching an accuracy level of approximately 93%, indicating strong predictive power for the given historical data.

### 5. Prediction and Visualization
After training, I switch the model to evaluation mode to generate predictions. I reverse the scaling of the predictions to match the original price range and then plot the predicted prices against the actual closing prices to visualize accuracy.

### Dependencies
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`
